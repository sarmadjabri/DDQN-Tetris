# DDQN-Tetris
Double DQN neural network paired with reinforcement learning to learn and beat the game of tetris

Will upload the IML file soon!


Dependencies/Packages:
  Tensorflow
  Keras
  matplotlib
  and whatever you see on the imports

How to run project:
  Please run the DQNTraintetris.py file in order to simply train the agent without attempting to graph its movements corresopnding to its reward
  Please run the DQNTetris.py file in order to train the model and graph for all the components to work
  Note that these processes are cpu intensive and I havent trained them nor will provide my progress on my training so far(im lazy burn your comoputer)
